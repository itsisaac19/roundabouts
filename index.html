                <div>Traditional intersections are some of the most dangerous places on the road. With traffic crossing in every direction, one mistake can lead to a devastating T-bone crash that causes serious injuries or deaths. Even when traffic lights work, safety depends on perfect timing and attention, which drivers are rarely able to maintain.</div>

                    <div class="conflict-title">What are Conflict Points?</div>
                    <div class="conflict-description">A conflict point is defined as any spot where two vehicles' paths can intersect, merge, or diverge. A traditional 4-way single-lane intersection has 32 vehicle to vehicle conflict points.</div>
                    <div class="conflict-subheading">Crossing Conflicts</div>
                    <div class="conflict-description">
                        These occur where traffic streams intersect at right angles, such as when one car drives straight through while another turns across its path. They create the highest risk for deadly T-bone crashes, which strike vehicles directly from the side. Because drivers often approach at full speed, these collisions are violent and frequently fatal.
                    </div>
                    <div class="conflict-subheading">Merging Conflicts</div>
                    <div class="conflict-description">
                        These happen when one lane of traffic joins another moving in the same direction, like when a driver turns right into ongoing traffic. While less severe than crossing crashes, they can still cause sideswipes or rear-end collisions when drivers misjudge gaps or fail to yield.
                    </div>
                    <div class="conflict-subheading">Diverging Conflicts</div>
                    <div class="conflict-description">
                        These arise when one stream of traffic splits into two, such as when a vehicle slows to turn off the main road. Rear-end crashes are common here, as following drivers may not react quickly enough. Although frequent, these collisions are usually minor compared to other types.
