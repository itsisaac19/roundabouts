                <div>Traditional intersections are some of the most dangerous places on the road. With traffic crossing
                    in every direction, one mistake can lead to a devastating T-bone crash that causes serious injuries
                    or deaths. Even when traffic lights work, safety depends on perfect timing and attention, which
                    drivers are rarely able to maintain.</div>

                        <div class="conflict-description">A conflict point is defined as any spot where two vehicles'
                            paths can intersect, merge, or diverge. A traditional 4-way single-lane intersection has 32
                            conflict points.</div>

                            These occur where traffic streams intersect at right angles. They are the highest risk for
                            deadly T-bone crashes, which strike vehicles directly from the side. When drivers move
                            through intersections at full speed, these collisions are violent and frequently fatal.

                            These happen when one lane of traffic joins another moving in the same direction. They
                            usually involve sideswipes or rear-end collisions when drivers fail to yield.

                            These conflicts arise when a stream of traffic splits into two, like when a vehicle slows
                            down to exit off a main road. Rear-end crashes are common in this case, as tailgating
                            drivers may not react quickly enough.

                        Roundabouts aren't the perfect solution for every intersection. Older research suggests a more
                        careful design approach is needed to ensure greater safety for pedestrians and cyclists.
                        However, modern roundabout designs have made significant strides in addressing these concerns
                        through features like dedicated crosswalks, bike lanes, and improved signage.

                        Roundabouts offer a transformative approach to intersection design that prioritizes safety,
                        efficiency, and sustainability. By minimizing conflict points, they significantly reduce the
                        likelihood of severe crashes, making roads safer for all users. Their continuous flow design
                        enhances traffic efficiency, cutting down wait times and increasing vehicle throughput.
                        Additionally, roundabouts contribute to environmental sustainability by lowering emissions and
                        reducing maintenance needs. As urban areas continue to grow and traffic demands increase,
                        roundabouts present a viable solution for modern transportation challenges.
