                <div>Traditional intersections are some of the most dangerous places on the road. With traffic crossing in every direction, one mistake can lead to a devastating T-bone crash that causes serious injuries or deaths. Even when traffic lights work, safety depends on perfect timing and attention, which drivers are rarely able to maintain.</div>

                    <div class="conflict-title">What are Conflict Points?</div>
                    <div class="conflict-description">A conflict point is defined as any spot where two vehicles' paths can intersect, merge, or diverge. A traditional 4-way single-lane intersection has 32 conflict points.</div>
                    <div class="conflict-subheading">Crossing Conflicts</div>
                    <div class="conflict-description">
                        These occur where traffic streams intersect at right angles. They are the highest risk for deadly T-bone crashes, which strike vehicles directly from the side. When drivers move through intersections at full speed, these collisions are violent and frequently fatal.
                    </div>
                    <div class="conflict-subheading">Merging Conflicts</div>
                    <div class="conflict-description">
                        These happen when one lane of traffic joins another moving in the same direction. They usually involve sideswipes or rear-end collisions when drivers misjudge gaps or fail to yield.
                    </div>
                    <div class="conflict-subheading">Diverging Conflicts</div>
                    <div class="conflict-description">
                        These conflicts arise when a stream of traffic splits into two, like when a vehicle slows down to exit off a main road. Rear-end crashes are common in this case, as tailgating drivers may not react quickly enough.
